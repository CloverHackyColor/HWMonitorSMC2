/* Simple rule to follow
 
 SMC_Aaa_Bbb, where:
 
 SMC stand for SMC key
 Aaa stand for the hardware involved (e.g. DIMM for memory DIMM on the Main Logic Board)
 BBB(...) stand for the type (linke TEMP for temperature, FREQ for frequency, VOLT for voltage and so on)
 
 An additional suffix like _F (i.e. SMC_Aaa_Bbb_F) to let understand this is a fake key
 that doesn't exist in the Apple World... maybe added by a third party driver.
